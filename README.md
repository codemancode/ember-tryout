## Ember Tryout

Thanks in part to [Tom Brandt](http://twbrandt.github.com/2013/02/11/Ember-Quick_Start_Guide/) wonderful ember walkthrough, the [ember docs](http://emberjs.com/guides) and the [Fire Up Ember.js Peepcode screencast](https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs).

### Start the server

Since the browser refused to run javascript from the filesystem locally, you can run a barebones python http server in order to not have to upload all your stuff.

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3001

Then go to your browser and hit localhost:3001.
